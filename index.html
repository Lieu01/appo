        <h1>I'm Sorry Guys.</h1>
        <p>Dear Abbey & Meya.,</p>
        <p>I am truly sorry for the past few weeks,  I’ve been reflecting on my actions and I realize that I owe you guys a really  sincere apology. I know I’ve been distant lately, and I wanted  to be honest with you about why I acted the way I did. I kind of got caught up in my own world after sem 1, and instead of dealing with my own feelings, I ended up projecting my failure onto you. I kinda blamed you for things that weren’t your fault, and i ended up hurting you guys ,  youve always been there for me, and I let my own feelings of failure kinda of get in the way of that. I mistook my inadequacy  for anger at you, and I expressed it poorly. I’m truly sorry for shutting you out when you guys didn’t deserve it. You didn’t cause anything ,, I let my emotions take control, and I took it out on you guys I am going to work on being better and learning from this mistake. I value our friendship so much, and I regret making you feel like I didn’t thank you guys for always being there w me and Ik this is a shitty apology but I have a word limit of my website thingy so ill type a better one on snap but I really care and love you guys am sorry for being super dingus don't kys. (this took ages please im going to cry if you dont accept)
 I Love you guys very Much. Please forgive me.also enjoy video.</p>
